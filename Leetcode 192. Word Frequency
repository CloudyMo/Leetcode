Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
For example, assume that words.txt has the following content:

# Read from the file words.txt and output the word frequency list to stdout.

###
### sort | uniq -c
###

###
### sort -k 2 -r -n
###

for i in `cat words.txt`;do echo $i;done | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $2" "$1}' | sort -k 2 -r -n
